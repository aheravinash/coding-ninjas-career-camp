Frequency Palindrome

You are given a string and then Q queries are given on that string. In each query, you will be given a starting and ending index, 
that will denote the starting and ending vertex of a substring of the given string, and you have to check if the given substring is freq-palindrome.

A string is called a freq-palindrome if it has the same frequency of characters in both the halves.

Sample Input 1:
heleltronrocop
3
1 3
0 4
6 10

Sample Output 1:
Yes
No
Yes

Explanation:
For query [ 1 3 ], substring is ‘ele’, which is a Freq-Palindrome
For query [ 0 4 ], substring is ‘helel’, which is NOT a Freq-Palindrome
For query [ 6 10 ], substring is ‘ronro’, which is a Freq-Palindrome

Sample Input 2:
