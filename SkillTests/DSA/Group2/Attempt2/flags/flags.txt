Flags

A flag can consists of only three different colors of stripes, White(W), Blue(B) and Red(R). Given an integer N, find and return the number of ways
to create such flags having N stripes consisting of these three color stripes only with the following constraints -

1. Stripes of the same color cannot be placed next to each other.
2. A blue stripe must always be placed between a white and a red or between a red and a white one. Hence blue stripe cannot be placed at starting 
or at ending.
3. Its not necessary to use all three colors.
