Given an integer n, break it into smaller numbers such that their summation is equal to n. Print all such combinations in different lines.

Note: [1,2,1] and [1,1,2] are same, so print the particular sequence with increasing order. Order of different combinations doesn't matter.

Input format: Integer n

Output format: Print all possible combinations in different lines.

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 100

Sample Input: 4

Sample Output: 

1 1 1 1
1 1 2
1 3
2 2
4
