www : World Wide Web : invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989

HTML : HyperText Markup Language : Structure of Webpage

CSS : Cascading Style Sheets : Design of Webpage

Javascript : Interactive webpage and animations

Client-Server Architecture : The code of the website (html, css, js etc)(resource) resides on a
server a client browser requests the code to the server to show the webpage to
the user. The server responds with the code. The client communicates with server for webpages. This is
Client-Server Archituecture.

Static vs Dynamic website : If the content of the website is same for all
users, the website is static (e.g wikipedia); if the content of the website is
different for different users (content is user specific), the website is
dynamic (e.g. facebook)

Front End : Client Side Section : Web Browser : We are worried about the
presentation of the data and not the data itself.

Back End : Server Side : Database, Authentication etc.

IP address : All the devices connected to the internet have a unique id that
is the ip address.

DNS : Domain Name System : Its hard to remember IP addresses so we have domain
names.

How website is loaded? 
enter url (uniform resource locator) -> if the browser has not cached the url
and its corresponding IP address, browser contacts ISP (internet service
provider) for IP address -> if the ISP has not cached the url and IP address,
it performs a domain name search (DNS search) and returns the address to the
browser -> browser contacts and connects with the server.
